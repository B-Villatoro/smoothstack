#Assignment One: Star Patterns.

StarPattern is located in the com.company package. The functionality includes: Take in user input to dictate how pattern will be sorted. Take in user input on how large the pattern will be by rows. Depending on user choice the pattern will be sorted in one of four ways. A half pyramid, a reverse half pyramid, a pyramid, or a reverse pyramid.

#Asignment Two:Addition through the command line, Max number in 2d matrix, and shapes interface.

Addition through the command line and Max number in 2d matrix are both located in com.company package. Shapes interface is located in com.company.interfaceShapes.

Addition through the command line will prompt the user on how many numbers will be added together. Then will prompt the user on each individual number it would like to add together. The numbers will be calculated and then return to the user.

Max number in 2d matrix will prompt the user on how many rows will be in the matrix. Then it will prompt for how many columns. The program will then create a random matrix between 0 and 99. The program will locate the max number in that matrix and return the max number along with it's location in the matrix. 

Shapes interface is an example of an interface file that provides the guideline of what will be included by the shapes that implement the interface. Three classes were created based on the interface. Circle, Rectange, and Triangle were created. They each include a calculateArea method as well as a display method. The calculateArea method will prompt the user on what the area is of a given shape. The display method will prompt the user if the shape is actively shown.
